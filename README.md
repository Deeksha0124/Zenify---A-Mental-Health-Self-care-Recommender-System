## Troubleshooting
| Issue                              | Solution                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: flask`       | Run `pip install flask`               |
| `No module named tensorflow.keras` | Run `pip install tensorflow`          |
| VS Code showing missing imports    | Check Python Interpreter & Virtualenv |
| App not opening on browser         | Ensure Flask is running on port 5000  |
